1. tell me a little bit about yourself?

Good afternoon, interviewer, It is my honor to introduce myself here. You can call me Jack.

My name is Jack, 37 years old, born in Xi'an, graduated from Xi'an Polytechnic University in computer science and Technology in 2008

So far I have more than 10 years work experience and served in 4 different companies

I started off my career as development engineer in Shaan'xi electric power company. That position is kind of a full stack engineer, back-end use JAVA, and the front end use javascript/css/html. I was in charge of / My work including: development interface between the system I am responsible and other systems, trained key customers, maintain the relationship for company, I was in that position over 6 years,  Because of long-term business trip, I left there



My second job was in Active-Network as an application support engineer, I was responsible for dealing with customer requested issues, provide solution for customers, deployed and upgrade target systems, 24 hours on-call, and shared top 10 issues and experience to other team member



usually, when I got an issue, (picked up by myself or assigned by team leader), what I did was to reproduce it first, if It could reproduced, then I analyzed the issue to find the root cause,  if it just was an operation problem, I will tell the customer how to operate it correctly, if it was caused by dirty data, I will involve db team to handle it, then let customer to check if everything is fine, the worst case is that the problem is a true system bug, so I have to involve dev to fix it, after dev provided a hot-fix, I will let customer know when the issue resolved, I leave there due to some reason, my direct leader left, so no one help our team to push back at that time

then I had the opportunity to be a test and development engineer in Emerson, my duty include writing automated scrips, set up automated test environment, analyzed automated report and enhance automated framework enhancement, I worked in Agile team lasted more than one year,but,due to Emerson downsize itself, I went on to OUR United RT


This is my current job, Most of my work is same as in Emerson's, The major difference is that I finish my task independently. for the automation part, I do not have a colleague to discuss, to argue, to learn or to share, I have to do all things by myself, for example making decision. pushing automation project move on, you know, this is very very important to me, I not only consider how to write scripts, but also consider how to design automation project, like automation technical selection, how to organize the project structure, set up CI environment, integrate with other systems, so based on that, I feel more confident about my work and push myself a higher demands

- This company is a medical company, to be more precision, a producer of bit medical machine, like CT, so it is not a traditional IT company, something is very easy to push or to make in IT company, but in here, It is hard to push, which means, The voice of test team is not as louder as traditional IT company
- Maybe one or two months I have to go to hospital to do the test work, you know, There is radiation source in the machine, which means, I have opportunity to contact radiation closely, It's not good for heathy if working long-term in this situation
