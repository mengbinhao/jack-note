1. tell me a little bit about yourself
Good afternoon, interviewer, It is my honor to introduce myself here.You can call me Jack. 35 years old

I graduated from Xi' an Polytechnic University with bachelor degree in computer and science Technology in 2008

I have more thant 10 years work experience and worked for 4 different companies

I started off my career as JAVA delevopment engineer in Shaan'xi electric power company.I was in charge of development interface to other system, like ERP、OA system and so on, I alse assisted with training key customers, to maintain the relationship for company, I was in this position over 6 years, Beacuse of long-term business trip, I quit this job

My second job was in activeNetwork as an application support engineer, I was responsible for handling customer issues, when I got an issue, what I did was to reproduce it first, if I could reproduce it, then I analyzed the issue to find the root cause of them,  if it was an issue caused by customer, I will tell the customer how to operate it correctly, if it was caused by dirty data, I will involve db team to handle it, then let customer to check if everything is fine, the worst is that the problem is a true system bug, so I have to involve dev to fix it, after dev provided a hot-fix, I will let cutomer know when the issue resoved,from this job, In addition to my regular work, My english level improved quickly, this is my greatest achievement.then I had the opportunity to be a test and development engineer for Emerson

In Emerson my duty include writing automated test case, set up automated test environment, analyzed automated report and automated framework enhancement work, I worked in Agile team lasted more than one year,but,due to emerson downsize itself, I went on to OUR United RT

Which is my current job, Most of my work is same as Emerosn's, The major difference is that I finish my task independently. I mean automation part, I do not have a colleague to discuss, to argue, to learn or to share, I have to make a decision. you know, this is very very imporant to me, I not only consider how to write scripts, but also consider how to accomplish automation project, like the automation technology selection, how to organize the project structure, set up CI environment, integrate JENKINS with TestComplete, I am not just create an item in JENKINS like before, in Emerson,but also build the JENKINS environment and related JENKINS configuration, so based on that, I feel more confident about my work and push myself a higher demands
