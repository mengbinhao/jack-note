### GTRF under CMB
- I know GTRF from offical website, the full name of GTRF is **Global Trade and Receivables Finance**, it provides services and financing for buyers and suppliers throughout the trade cycle, helping them to use working capital efficiently, manage trade risk and fund their supply chains

This is a strategic department in Xi'an and do Devops、micro-service and interface work

 yeah, this is all i know about GTRF

- Good afternoon, interviewer, It is my honor to introduce myself here.You can call me Jack. native of Xi'An,35 years old. I graduated from Xi'an Polytechnic University in computer science and Technology in 2008.So far I have more than 10 years work experience and I worked in 4 companies.At the beginning I am a developer using JAVA to develop web system. but in recent years, I worked as a automated testing engineer.

In my current job, My duty include write automated scrips, set up automated test environment, analyze automated report, just like what I did in Emerson. but there is a major difference is that I am the only one person who did automated testing work. which means I finish my job independently. I donot have a colleague to discuss, to argue, to learn or to share, all of the automated thing I have to implement it by myself, you know, this is very very important to me, I am not just only consider how to write scripts, but also need to do, including technology selection, organize automated project, set up CI environment, integrate JENKINS with TestComplete, so based on that, I feel more confident about my work、my skills and push myself a higher demands


#### What do you like/want to join about the company?
- I want to join the industry in which HSBC is located. I am very happy to work with talented people all over the world with multi-cultures. This job is an ideal match for my skills and work experience. So I think I am qualified for this job. I believe I can do it well and I want to be part of HSBC.


#### Why do you want to change you job? why are you leaving your current position?
There are three factors
1. My current company is not a traditional IT company, which means the weight of test is not as heavier as I expected. It is a bit little harder to extend automated project.
2. Sometimes I have to go to customer there, go to hosipital for testing, operate the radiation machine, so I have opportunity to contact radiation, this is another major reason that I want to change my jog
3. I want to advance my carrer, and I think this job offers more opportunities for me to do that, I am ready for a bigger challenge


#### What is the biggest accomplishment form these jobs?
- After finishing the automation project, we saw a 40% increase in test team efficiency
- Scrum team is my customer, they told me the synchronization tools saves lots of their time.
- I mean I am pround of deliverring the synchronization tool between starteam and rally to scrum team



### TPS automated project
The TPS automated project to build for testing target desktop application, this target application is used  to make treatment plan for our customer. test the UI function of the application by automation using testcomplete,
it purpose is to save tester time, so they can do other thing

What I did is convert manual cases to automated cases using javascript, organize the project structure, set up CI environment. update  automated cases, analyze the test report.

For now, I finished nearly 60% percent of cases automatize.we saw a 40% increase in test team efficiency, normally, tester need spend 2 days to test new version of the application, but now less than half day to do it

from this project, I have learned a lot javascript knowledge, , I use is more skilled. but there is a little regret, most of the scripts written by ES5 grammar, if I have enought time, I will refactor it to ES6 grammar, this is the trend,futhermore, I did not write the unit test for my business code,if I have opportunity I add them as well


- leanrning cost, TC support lots of script language, js python, shell
- price, it is a small company, although it has several branch company, but you know, as I said above, other department have louder voice
- can resolve current work problem(UI automated testing， windows desktop application development by QT5)
- easily reading offical doc(I spent a lot of time,almost one month to learn how to use TC)
- community (I requeQT5sted several topic there and I found a bug of TC, TC built a hot-fix for this bug)
- popular or not
- expansibility


test environment, particular dicom image, machine
common function like get data from different table. gotomainUI

image compare.
organize folder according to the funciton module
src folder is same as testlink's
build-in event at the beginning of one case started
write buseness coder first, then automated case invoke them
each single case test cycle is, lauch target app first, do some operation to go to the checkpoint, at last checkproperty to see if it is the case expeted. exit app

### oxygen
this is an automated test framework develepted by Emerson, Automation team, it is used to test different web system. Oxygen resolves lots of xml files to related bean to excute automated cases, after it is done, geratate report then send to related pepole. the main technology stacks are java and selenium, JAVA en'capsulates selenium
more precisely speaking, it is a semi-finished product, Oxygen defines many type of web components, but all of them are abstract class.(like button、link、table、checkbox、textinput and others) which means the target system have to implement those components if needed

actually, I am not totally understand about each technical point, because when i joined the group, the framwrok has alreay in shape, what I did is enhance work and write automated test case and update componets, but I am clear that how it works, the workflow of Oxygen, Is this fine that I show you this information?

encapsulation
poly'morphism

Basic actions:
- Web: perform a single operation on a specified page.Such as click on a button or type string into a text input.
- System: perform a single operation on local computer system. Such as isFileExists, deleteOneFile, etc.
- Browser: perform a single operation on the browser.Such as refresh, getCurrentUrl, openNewWindow, etc.
- Database: perform a single operation on the database.Such as queryDB, modifyDB, etc.


Activity: perform a suite of actions to finish a business logic. Such as login system or add a new user.


A Web action has 4 properties:
page: indicate to which page will be operated on
widget: indicate to which widget will be operated on
method: indicate to which method will be called at back end
parameters: indicate to which value will be parameter for specified method, multiple values are separated by comma.

how to run
1. first oxygen converts pre-defined xml into related Bean stored in context, is a big data

What I did is convert manual cases to automated cases using javascript, update automated cases, set up CI environment during regressing, analyze the test report, enhance framework and define components

Scrum team is my customer, Oxygen saves lots of their time during regressing, nearly one thousands cases(including manual case and automated case are run within one week)

from this project, I learned lots of automation knowledge, how to excute automated test case, how to set up automate env
